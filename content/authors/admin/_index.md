I am a third year PhD student in [materials science and engineering at the University of Florida](https://mse.ufl.edu/). My research is focused on understanding the mechanical behavior of metals using advanced computational techniques.

Outside of work, my personal interests and hobbies include martial arts, movies, hiking, and spending time with my cats.
