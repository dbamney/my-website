  **Research Objectives** - The objective of this research is to develop a multiscale simulation approach to study dislocation â€“ grain boundary interactions and to employ this approach to advance criteria for slip transfer across grain boundaries to consider the grain boundary damage state. In addition, the proposed simulation approach will allow for an analysis of the role of dislocation core structures on slip transfer. 
  
  **Research Outcomes**:
  * Implemented atomistically-derived Al dislocation mobility laws into discrete dislocation dynamics (DDD) model to accurately characterize the role of dislocation core structure on the kinetics of dislocation slip.
  
  
  * Developed and implemented virtual x-ray diffraction tools for the characterization of dislocation-induced strain broadening in plastically deformed microstructures.
